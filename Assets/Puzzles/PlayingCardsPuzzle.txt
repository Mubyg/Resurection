On the desk is a pack of playing cards. Uppon oppening you find, that the picture on the back of the cards is a dandellion.

If you look about the room, you will se many different pictures around. One of them is a picture of a field with all the different kinds of flours (including dandeliions). If you move this picture, you will find a small compartment with the TV remote and a postcard from the Nedderlands (tulips). When you try to turn on the TV, you have to write in the password (TULIP) to turn it on and get the next rune.
